**Assignment Requirements**

This assignment requires you to complete the following four tasks. Detailed instructions for each task are given below. The picture of the completed web page included below indicates the location within the web page that will be updated by the four tasks.

**Task 1**

In this task you will move the table reservation form from the last content row into a modal. You should also remove the last content row.

- The form should be completely shifted to a modal.
- Add a Cancel button in the form that will dismiss the modal when clicked.
- The modal header should contain a X button to dismiss the modal.

**Task 2**

In this task you will be adding a radio button group to the form to allow the selection of the smoking/non-smoking section of the restaurant.

- The row containing the button group will have the label Section displayed preceding it in the form.

Note: Read [Bootstrap Buttons Checkbox/Radio](http://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/buttons/#checkbox-and-radio-buttons) for more information on how to design checkbox/radio buttons.

**Task 3**

In this task you will be updating the Reserve Table button in the Jumbotron:

- Remove the tooltip from the button. This is to facilitate the button to be used to trigger the modal containing the table reservation form in the later tasks.

Also remove the corresponding JavaScript code for the tooltip from the bottom of the page.
- You will update the Reserve Table button to show the modal containing the table reservation form when the button is clicked.
